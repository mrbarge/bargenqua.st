      <description>It&#39;s the end of the year, so I figured I&#39;d kick this blog off by highlighting the excellent work of other authors&amp;rsquo; blogs, articles and long-reads which I enjoyed through the year. This is by no means a comprehensive list - I&#39;m just going through things in my Instapaper account, which is largely just stuff I thought to archive rather than delete once I&#39;d read it. And, there&#39;s an obvious technology bias towards the content.</description>
